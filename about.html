            <div class="documentation">
            The assignment for this website is to be a website developer that was approached by their uncle for help in developing a website for his small business. He asked for a visually appealing website that will need to have tables, forms, and a variety of multimedia elements. There will be five pages in total which include a home page and about page. <br>
            My assignment is for Uncle Tobias, a German Shorthaired Pointer fanatic who spends his entire life dedicated to these types of dogs. He wishes to share his passion for the breed with the world and create a platform to sell his handmade items such as bandanas, toys, and photo prints. <br>
            The steps included figuring out which elements would appeal to the customers that would likely view this website. Rough sketches of each page’s layout were made for each page’s baseline. Each page was then created and analyzed. After all pages were created, links and elements were checked. Then a thorough check of the rubric was made to ensure each assignment object was met.

            <div class="defense">
                During World War II, the German government required all spotted GSPs be eliminated as they did not camouflage with the forest. Breeders sent their dogs to neighboring countries to protect their existence. Some migrated with immigrants.

            <div class="akc">
            If I had more time and resources for this website, I would make adjustments within each page to align margins and element sizes. I'd also like to play with the navigation bar a little more and change the color scheme to it. It would be good to change the header text to a different font as well to make it stand out a little more. I would love to add a page with information with GSP rescues and Veterinary help lines such as the animal poison control hotline, payment resources for those in crisis such as animal care credit.
